# Introductory Collaboratory Repository

### Hello and welcome new members to this fundamentals repo! :blue_heart:

My name is Ibrahim Adil and I will be your assistant in these preliminary GitHub endeavours. 
The purpose of said endeavours is to just make sure we all know what we're doing and have the basics down.

Given the lot of you seem to be quite familiar already (to my genuine delight) with how GitHub works, I have but two demands

**1. Fork this repository, then make the following change to the 
[section below the horizontal line](https://github.com/ib-bib/CodeCollaborationBasics/#your-quotes-go-here) 
and make a pull request for me to merge your edit**

Your Name - Some Inspirational Quote - Quote Author

([e.g.](https://study.com/learn/lesson/what-does-e-g-stand-for.html) Ibrahim Adil - "Macaroni & Cheese is awesome" - A Real Human Being)

*Take care when you make a pull request; ensure that your version is not conflicting with the current version.*

*Communicate to the other memebrs when you are ready to make a pull request, such that everyone else updates their forks and no repo is behind on any commits.*

**2. Create a repository of your own, be it public or private, and invite me as a collaborator on it. 
Then, make another branch in which I will make some changes. 
I will make a pull request, you should merge my pull request to that branch, then merge it to the main/master branch**

*Never fret to ask any questions for clarification, or suggest and comment on any mistake you notice needs correction* :smile:
